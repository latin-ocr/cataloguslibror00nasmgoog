'A large paper' hook in fiilio, containing

Tne Romance of the St. Grayl.

It is with diffidence that 1 have ventured to offic to this aniene a title so
different to that which it has borne in former catalogues; especially as 1 must
acknowledge that the exceffiiie length os this poem, which corffls of not les
than forty thousand lines, deterreri rnefronc attempting the perusal of it. The
book is imperfeol both at the beginning and at the end, the title at che top of
the first page, viz. “ Aeta qaaedm Arthacri regis, which bas been nan-
firibed by Janes and Stonley, appears to nce to have been written by Joceline
secretary to anchbishop Parher. How little paint this learned enan gave
himselsc to discover the true title os this poen, ared in what contempt he held
these first efforts of the British must es coedent from the follwoeng sentence in-
scrihed by him on a blank leaf at the beginning ff this volum,

“Oh quantos labores infamabit hic antor in rebat non improbabilibus?

As fier as 1 can judge srorn a carfiey revisal, the whole es one continued
